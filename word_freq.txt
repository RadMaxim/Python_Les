Hester was a beautiful woman whose family was important and powerful.
But she had no luck. Hester fell in love and got married.
But her marriage became dull and empty.
She had three beautiful children - a boy and two girls.
But she did not love them.
Hester pretended that she loved them, but she knew that she did not.
Hester's husband travelled to the city each day and worked in an office.
But he was not very successful in his job and did not earn much money.
Hester did not know how to make money either.
They both spent more money than they could earn.
So they had serious money problems.
Hester and her family lived in a fine house, which had a pleasant garden.
Beautiful and expensive things filled the house.
The children had all the toys that they wanted.
But sometimes it seemed that a voice was whispering in the house.
The children could hear the voice all the time.
Nobody spoke about it, but the whisper was everywhere.
There must be more money!
There must be more money!
Hester's son was called Paul.
